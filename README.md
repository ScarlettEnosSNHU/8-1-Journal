  In this project, I was assigned the task of developing an item-tracking system for The Corner Grocer. 
The program is intended to read text records of items purchased throughout the day and count the frequency 
in which they are purchased. The Corner Grocer intends to use this program to optimize the layout of their 
store for their customers by placing more frequently purchased items in higher traffic areas.
  I successfully met all of the functional requirements which included printing a menu with four different options
for users as well as counting and writing item frequencies to the frequency.dat file. I also implemented a class
with public and private sections and placed my code in three separate files for extra organization.
  An area I think I can improve is how I handle errors in my code. Learning what certain error messages
mean and how to fix them will improve the efficiency of my code as well as help me write code
that can avoid these errors in the future. The piece of code I found most challenging to write was the map. 
I had no prior experience using maps in a program. During this project, I was eventually able to successfully implement 
a map but that was not without many errors and challenges. Since maps require precise coding syntax, I think I can use more 
practice implementing maps.
  The skills obtained from this project will transfer well into other courses and projects. The skills I built are an
understanding of the C++ programming language and an understanding of OOP principles. Both of these will help me 
in future programming coursework as well as future career endeavors. I made my program maintainable, readable, and adaptable
by separating it into separate files and using in-line comments. Separating into multiple files ensures organization 
as well as ease of maintenance and modification in case The Corner Grocer wishes to add more features to the program 
in the future. Including in-line comments ensures readability in my code.
